## üê£ Introduction
The current code is about converting currency, for example USD into Euro, British Pund Sterlingand Japanese Yen.

```sh
‚ùØ cd /path/to/workspace/3-musketeers/cash
‚ùØ npm i
‚ùØ node bin/index.js

# this is what we can in the console
‚àö 0.883 (EUR) Euro
‚àö 0.773 (GBP) British Pound Sterling
‚àö 110.549 (JPY) Japanese Yen

Conversion of USD 1
```

Let's see in detail how to do a program like this.


## üìÅ The different files
Before anything else, create a new folder named `cash`, with 2 folders in it named `bin` and `library`.   
`bin` will be the folder in which we will stock all of our `file.js` (meaning `cash.js`, `constants.js` and `index.js`, that we will present later).   
`library` will be the folder in which we will stock a JSON file with every currency symbol definitions.

After creating those folder, you need to install `package.json` by doing in the console :

```sh
‚ùØ npm install
```

Then check in the `package.json` created that it looks like this :

```sh
{
	"name": "cash",
	"license": "MIT",
	"main": "index.js",
	"bin": {
		"cash": "./bin/index.js"
	},
	"dependencies": {
		"chalk": "^2.4.1",
		"conf": "^2.1.0",
		"got": "^9.4.0",
		"meow": "^5.0.0",
		"money": "^0.2.0",
		"ora": "^3.0.0"
	}
}
```

We can now begin to code the currency conversion program.


### constants.js
In your `bin` folder, create a new file named `constants.js`.

```sh
const API = 'https://api.exchangeratesapi.io/latest';
const DEFAULT_TO_CURRENCIES = ['USD', 'EUR', 'GBP', 'JPY'];

module.exports = {
  API,
  DEFAULT_TO_CURRENCIES
}
```

The purpose of this code is to get all the exchange rate for all currency based on the Euro, according to the latest update of the [API](https://api.exchangeratesapi.io/latest). For example, we can know that 1 EUR equals 1.1328 USD.   
Then, in `DEFAULT_TO_CURRENCIES` we stock the currencies we are interesting in.   

To be able to use those constants in an other file (meaning here in `cash.js`), we export them.


### cash.js
In your `bin` folder, create a new file named `cash.js`.   
The very first step is to import the libraries we will have to use for the function to implement.

```sh
'use strict';

const got = require('got');
const money = require('money');
const chalk = require('chalk');
const ora = require('ora');
const currencies = require('../lib/currencies.json');

const {API} = require('./constants');
```


### index.js
